### What I got done this week

Selected the subject and did some initial research on the algorithms. Did some research on the possible tech stack.

### How did the project progress this week?

The design document is ready. I also have an working template for the project.

### What new did I learn this week

I researched Deno as an alternative for Node for this project. It would be nice alternative for the current Node stack I have set up.

### What caused issues?

Nothing

### What do I plan to do next?

Implement the first algorithm as completely as possible. Finalize the tech stack (Node vs Deno, Jest vs Merlin), Deno has some nice benefits for having a lot of the stack built in and therefore tsc, prettier, eslit and typedoc would no longer be necessary. I have to also decide if I'll run the algorithms on the client or on the server. The separation of client and server would likely make the tests more accurate.

### Hours spent this week

A few
