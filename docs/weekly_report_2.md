### What I got done this week

Converted the project from Node to Deno. Some typing work on the Dijkstra algorithm. Added initial guide.

### How did the project progress this week?

The project now has a better base to work on.

### What new did I learn this week

How to use Deno for testing, code formatting, linting etc.

### What caused issues?

Nothing

### What do I plan to do next?

I plan to implement the support for maps. A lot of technical details to be figured out regarding that. The plan is to run the calculations on the server side and display the results in the browser. Hook up the Dijkstra's algorithm to whatever data I'll actually use.

### Hours spent this week

A few
